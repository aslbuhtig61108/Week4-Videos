		// is still existing memory.. All the strings created are all in memory, which is called a memory leak
		
		// When should be a string be used? Answer: Strings are very useful in programming and should only used them 
		// when you have a value that is not going to change a bunch
		
		// Like if you're going to be combining char and strings together, a string is not the object type you want to use
		// you would like to use a STRINGBUILDER

		// multiple strings in memory
		
		// CONCLUSION: A string is immutable and a stringbuilder is mutable. 
		// A stringbuilder allows you to manipulate the parts of a string and that convert the final 
		// product to a string without the overhead of a string.
